# Side Project: Recreating "Kerosene Bouncing Ball" Video

For a recent side project, I drew inspiration from a captivating YouTube video that I stumbled upon. The concept of the video intrigued me, and I found myself drawn to explore it further. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Peo-DIOmmRo&list=LL&index=6) is the link to the video. 

## Objective

My main goal was to enhance my JavaScript skills and delve into new programming concepts while experimenting with innovative techniques.

## Implementation

I used libraries like Tone.js for audio manipulation and React.js for frontend development. HTML Canvas was instrumental in creating dynamic visual effects and animations to replicate the bouncing ball's motion from the video.

## Features

- **Audio Synchronization**: I synchronized the ball's movement with background music, creating an immersive audiovisual experience.
  
- **Customization**: Users can customize various aspects of the gameplay, including audio tracks, visual effects, and game mechanics.

## Conclusion

This project served as both a creative challenge and a learning opportunity. By combining inspiration from the video with my unique ideas, I honed my programming skills and explored new possibilities in animation and game development. Ultimately, it was a fulfilling journey that showcased the versatility and creativity of JavaScript.
